Subject: [PATCH 38/48] sched: Infrastructure to query if load balancing is
 energy-aware

Energy-aware load balancing should only happen if the ENERGY_AWARE feature
is turned on and the sched domain on which the load balancing is performed
on contains energy data.
There is also a need during a load balance action to be able to query if we
should continue to load balance energy-aware or if we reached the tipping
point which forces us to fall back to the conventional load balancing
functionality.
