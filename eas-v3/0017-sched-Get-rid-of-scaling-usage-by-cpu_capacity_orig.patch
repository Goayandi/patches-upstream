Subject: [PATCH 17/48] sched: Get rid of scaling usage by cpu_capacity_orig

Since now we have besides frequency invariant also cpu (uarch plus max
system frequency) invariant cfs_rq::utilization_load_avg both, frequency
and cpu scaling happens as part of the load tracking.
So cfs_rq::utilization_load_avg does not have to be scaled by the original
capacity of the cpu again.
