Subject: [PATCH 41/48] sched: Introduce energy awareness into
 find_busiest_group

In case that after the gathering of sched domain statistics the current
load balancing operation is still in energy-aware mode, just return the
least efficient (costliest) reference. That implies the system is
considered to be balanced in case no least efficient sched group was
found.
