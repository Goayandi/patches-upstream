Subject: [PATCH 44/48] sched: Tipping point from energy-aware to conventional
 load balancing

Energy-aware load balancing bases on cpu usage so the upper bound of its
operational range is a fully utilized cpu. Above this tipping point it
makes more sense to use weighted_cpuload to preserve smp_nice.
This patch implements the tipping point detection in update_sg_lb_stats
as if one cpu is over-utilized the current energy-aware load balance
operation will fall back into the conventional weighted load based one.
